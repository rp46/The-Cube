# The-Cube
The cube is a rolling cube game inspired by the original game named edge. It is made in unity. It's my first unity3d project.<br>
Just download the repo, open in unity and build for windows(/linux/mac) and run.<br>
Controls are:<br>
Arrow keys for movements.<br>
Left and right clicks for the two camera views.<br>
'k' for screenshots.
