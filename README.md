# The-Cube
The cube is a rolling cube game inspired by the original game named edge. It is made in unity. It's my first unity3d project.
Just download the repo, open in unity and build for windows(/linux/mac) and run.
Controls are:
Arrow kwys for movements.
Left and right clicks for the camera.
'k' for screenshots.
